# Multi-stage build following the convention app-ci.yml (nyc_pa_aws_gitops)
# relies on: a `lint` stage and a `test` stage ahead of the final runtime
# stage, so the platform's CI workflow stays language-agnostic instead of
# hardcoding Python tooling. `docker build` with no --target builds the
# last stage (`final`) -- exactly what app-build-push.yml pushes to ECR.

# Base images from public.ecr.aws/docker/library, AWS's mirror of Docker's official images: no Docker Hub
# rate limits or outages (Bill, 2026-10-09; nyc_pa_aws_gitops docs/gotchas.md).
